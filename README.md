# Generative AI Learning

This repository folder contains learning materials, notes, tutorials, and small experiments focused on generative AI.

## Purpose

- Organize study materials, reference code, and experiments about generative models.
- Provide a discoverable, easy-to-contribute workspace for learning and teaching.

## Key concepts (suggested topics)

- Generative models (overview)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) — DCGAN, StyleGAN, CycleGAN
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Diffusion models (DDPM, score-based models, Stable Diffusion)
- Transformers and attention mechanisms
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive generation
- Prompt engineering and prompt tuning
- Fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and LoRA
- Transfer learning and pretraining
- Self-supervised learning
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Multimodal models (CLIP, DALL·E, Flamingo)
- Text-to-image / image-to-image / image-to-text generation
- Text-to-speech and speech generation
- Music and audio generation
- Code generation and program synthesis
- Evaluation metrics (FID, Inception Score, BLEU, ROUGE, human eval)
- Data augmentation and synthetic data
- Model compression & inference optimization (quantization, distillation)
- Safety, ethics, and responsible AI

## Suggested folder structure

Use subfolders to keep things tidy. Example:

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks and experiments
- `implementations/` — reference code and small demos
- `papers/` — paper PDFs and notes
- `datasets/` — scripts to prepare or sample datasets (avoid storing large data)
- `slides/` — study slides and presentation material
- `resources/` — curated links, tutorials, and blog posts

## Resources (starter list)

- Papers: Goodfellow et al. (GANs), Kingma & Welling (VAE), Ho et al. (Diffusion)
- Hugging Face docs and model hub
- Distill.pub and other explainers on attention/transformers

## How to contribute

1. Add files under the appropriate subfolder and include a short README for that folder.
2. Add runnable examples (notebook or small script) for code demos.
3. Keep large datasets out of the repo; include download/prep scripts instead.

## Notes

- This is a living learning space. Feel free to reorganize topics or propose changes via a `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Happy learning — add your notes, code, and experiments as you explore generative AI.
